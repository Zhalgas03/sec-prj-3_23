# SEC-PRJ-3_23 ‚Äî Federated File System Encoding at the Edge in Smart Cities (MCU-based)

## Project Description
This project implements a proof-of-concept for a **federated secure filesystem** at the edge.  
The key idea: **an edge device cannot access its own secure data immediately after boot**.  
It must first authenticate with **multiple federated gateways**, collect decryption shares, and only then is able to mount its secure partition.

This simulates **Smart City** scenarios, where devices (e.g., ESP32 or Raspberry Pi class MCUs) depend on trusted gateways in the local network to unlock their encrypted storage.  
The design increases resilience: no single node can decrypt the data alone.

> **MCU note:** The repo contains **two clients**: a full PC client (`device/device.py`) that actually decrypts/mounts the secure file, and a **lightweight MCU-style client** (`esp32_client.py`) that authenticates to gateways, reconstructs the key, and signals `MOUNT_OK`. The MCU client is written in a MicroPython-friendly style (swap `requests` ‚Üí `urequests` on real ESP32).

## Features
- **AES-256-GCM encryption** for data-at-rest (secure file `device/secure_data.enc`).
- **Federated authorization**: device must contact **two gateways (A & B)** to unlock data.
- **Key sharing (2-of-2)**: master key is split via XOR into two independent shares (A, B). Each gateway holds one share; **no single gateway can recover the key**.
- **Two device clients**:
  - **PC client** ‚Äî `device/device.py`: gets both shares, reconstructs the key, **decrypts** and effectively ‚Äúmounts‚Äù the secure partition (prints plaintext).
  - **MCU prototype** ‚Äî `esp32_client.py`: authenticates to A & B, reconstructs the key, and prints `MOUNT_OK` (no heavy crypto/mount on-device). MicroPython-ready (on ESP32 replace `requests` with `urequests`).
- **Security**:
  - Requests authenticated with **HMAC** (`HMAC_SECRET` shared between device and gateways).
  - **Allowed-list** of device IDs on gateways (`ALLOWED_DEVICES`).
  - (Optional) **anti-replay window** using timestamp `ts` checked on the gateway.
- **Monitoring**: live events (`BOOT_LOCKED`, `AUTH_OK`, `MOUNT_OK/FAIL`) sent to **Telegram** from gateways.

## How it Works
1. **Provisioning**  
   - A random AES-256 key is generated and stored in `device/.env` (`DEVICE_KEY_B64`).  
   - This key is used to encrypt `secure_data.enc` with AES-256-GCM.  
   - Handled by `device/provision.py`.  

2. **Key Sharing**  
   - The master key is split into two independent shares (XOR split).  
   - Share A ‚Üí Gateway A, Share B ‚Üí Gateway B.  
   - Handled by `split_key.py`.  

3. **Boot & Authorization**  
   - Device powers on with partition locked.  
   - **PC client (`device/device.py`)**: sends `BOOT_LOCKED` event to both gateways.  
   - **MCU client (`esp32_client.py`)**: directly requests authorization.  
   - Both clients call `/authorize` on Gateway A and B with `{dev_id, ts, sig}` signed via HMAC.  
   - Gateways verify the request (device ID in allow-list, signature valid) and each returns its share.  

4. **Federation Unlock**  
   - Both clients reconstruct the master key via `A XOR B`.  
   - **PC client**: uses the reconstructed key to decrypt `secure_data.enc` (AES-256-GCM) and prints the plaintext (simulated ‚Äúmount‚Äù).  
   - **MCU client**: prints the reconstructed key and signals `MOUNT_OK` (without doing heavy AES-GCM on the microcontroller).  
   - Gateways log the status (`AUTH_OK`, `MOUNT_OK/FAIL`) and optionally push events to Telegram.

## Goals & Relevance
- Demonstrates how **federated trust** can protect edge devices in **Smart City** scenarios.  
- Ensures that **no single gateway can unlock encrypted storage** ‚Üí higher resilience and security.  
- Bridges concepts of **IoT security, distributed key management, and real-time monitoring**.  
- Lightweight implementation (Python + FastAPI) with both a **full PC client** and a **MicroPython-style MCU prototype** (ESP32 simulation), so no extra hardware is strictly required.

- ‚úÖ **MCU prototype (`esp32_client.py`)** implemented and verified.  
- ‚úÖ Telegram notifications integrated for live events.  
- üîú Planned extensions: Shamir‚Äôs Secret Sharing (K-of-N), Dockerized deployment, and direct ESP32 hardware port.
